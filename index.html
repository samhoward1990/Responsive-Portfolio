                <p>
                    I am a musician, teacher and now an aspiring web developer in Dallas, Texas. Musically I enjoy
                    playing jazz
                    and blues, as well as writing in many styles.
                    I have been teaching for over 5 years, and have taught students of all ages at several studios. I
                    have
                    played in several bands in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and enjoy collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a developer I hope to bring creative and logical solutions to my workplace. I also would like to
                    bring my
                    spirit of teamwork and collaboration that I have learned from working in bands to the tech field.
                    As an active learner I am looking forward to learning more everyday throughout my career.
